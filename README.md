# ðŸ¦· Teeth Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning pipeline for classifying different teeth conditions and diseases from image data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (ResNet50).
It also includes a Streamlit web application for real-time image classification.

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow
1. Data Loading

- Images are loaded using TensorFlowâ€™s image_dataset_from_directory() with:

- Image size: 224Ã—224

- Batch size: 32

2. Data Analysis

- Class distributions are visualized using Matplotlib to understand dataset balance.

3. Data Augmentation

- To enhance model generalization, random augmentations are applied:

    - Horizontal flip

    - Random rotation (Â±10%)

    - Zoom and contrast variations

4. Balancing Classes

- Data augmentation is repeated to generate balanced datasets.

- Each class is trimmed to a target of 600 samples.

5. Model Architectures

- Model 1 â€” Basic CNN

    - Conv2D + MaxPooling2D layers

    - Dense layers for classification

    - Softmax output layer with 7 classes

- Model 2 â€” CNN + GlobalAveragePooling

    - Uses GlobalAveragePooling2D() for dimensionality reduction

    - Simplifies dense layer parameters

- Model 3 â€” CNN with Residual Blocks

    - Adds residual connections to prevent vanishing gradients

    - Uses Adam(learning_rate=0.0005) optimizer

    - Achieved strong accuracy and stability

- Model 4 â€” Transfer Learning (ResNet50)

    - Uses pretrained ResNet50 (ImageNet weights) as a feature extractor

    - Adds custom dense layers for fine-tuning teeth disease classification

    - Best-performing model overall
